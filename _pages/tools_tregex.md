Tregex, Tsurgeon and Semgrex

### About

**Tregex** is a utility for matching patterns in trees, based on tree
relationships and regular expression matches on nodes (the name is short for
"tree regular expressions"). Tregex comes with **Tsurgeon** , a tree
transformation language. Also included from version 2.0 on is a similar
package which operates on dependency graphs (class `SemanticGraph`, called
**semgrex**.

**Tregex:** The best introduction to Tregex is the brief powerpoint tutorial
for Tregex by Galen Andrew. The best way to learn to use Tregex is by working
with the GUI (`TregexGUI`). It has help screens which summarize the syntax of
Tregex. You can find brief documentation of Tregex's pattern language on the
TregexPattern javadoc page, and, of course, you should also be very familiar
with Java regular expression syntax. Tregex contains essentially the same
functionality as TGrep2 (which had a superset of the functionality of the
original tgrep), plus several extremely useful relations for natural language
trees, for example "A is the lexical head of B", and "A and B share a (hand-
specified) variable substring" (useful for finding nodes coindexed with each
other). Because it does not create preprocessed indexed corpus files, it is
however somewhat slower than TGrep2 when searching over large treebanks, but
gains from being able to be run on any trees without requiring index
construction. As a Java application, it is platform independent, and can be
used programmatically in Java software. There is also both a graphical
interface (also platform independent) and a command line interface through the
`TregexPattern` main method. To launch the graphical interface double click
the stanford-tregex.jar file.

**Tsurgeon:** A good introduction is the powerpoint slides for Tsurgeon by
Marie-Catherine de Marneffe. Tsurgeon can be run from the command line and is
also incorporated into the TregexGUI graphical interface. Its syntax is
presented on the Tsurgeon javadoc page.

**Semgrex:** An included set of powerpoint slides and the  javadoc for
`SemgrexPattern` provide an overview of this package.

Tregex was written by Galen Andrew and Roger Levy. Tsurgeon was written by
Roger Levy. The graphical interface for both was written by Anna Rafferty. A
lot of bug fixing and various extensions to both were done by John Bauer.
Semgrex was written by Chloe Kiddon and John Bauer. These programs also rely
on classes developed by others as part of the Stanford JavaNLP project.

There is a paper describing Tregex and Tsurgeon. You're encouraged to cite it
if you use Tregex or Tsurgeon.

Tregex, Tsurgeon, and Semgrex are **licensed under theGNU General Public
License** (v2 or later). Note that this is the _full_ GPL, which allows many
free uses. For distributors of proprietary software, commercial licensing is
available. Source is included. The package includes components for command-
line invocation and a Java API.

  

### Questions

There is a tregex FAQ list (with answers!). Please send any other questions or
feedback, or extensions and bugfixes to `parser-user@lists.stanford.edu`.  

### Mailing Lists

We have 3 mailing lists for the Tregex/Tsurgeon, all of which are shared with
the Stanford Parser. Each is at `@lists.stanford.edu`:

  1. `parser-user` This is the best list to post to in order to ask questions, make announcements, or for discussion among Tregex/Tsurgeon users. Join the list via this webpage or by emailing `parser-user-join@lists.stanford.edu`. (Leave the subject and message body empty.) You can also look at the list archives. 
  2. `parser-announce` This list will be used only to announce new Tregex/Tsurgeon versions. So it will be very low volume (expect 1-3 message a year). Join the list via this webpage or by emailing `parser-announce-join@lists.stanford.edu`. (Leave the subject and message body empty.) 
  3. `parser-support` This list goes only to the Tregex/Tsurgeon maintainers. It's a good address for licensing questions, etc. **For general use and support questions, you're better off joining and using`parser-user`.** You cannot join `parser-support`, but you can mail questions to `parser-support@lists.stanford.edu`.
