# Contributing

We welcome bug fixes and contributions to Stanford CoreNLP.

However, please note that Stanford CoreNLP is copyrighted by Stanford University. As such, we require contributors to follow certain guidelines to ensure that contributions do not restrict Stanford from separately licensing the code.

You can contribute under any of the following terms:

1. **Bug Fixes**: If your contribution is a bug fix consisting of 6 lines or less of new code, we will accept it without further hassle.

2. **Public Domain**: You can declare your contribution to be in the public domain, either in your commit message or pull request.

3. **Open Source License**: You may make your contribution available under a non-restrictive open-source license, such as the Revised (or 3-clause) BSD license. Please include appropriate licensing information with your submitted code.

4. **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**: You can sign and return to us a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), granting us explicit permission to use your code. We provide a Contributor License Agreement for Individuals and a Contributor License Agreement for Corporations. You can send them to us or contact us for more information.

When contributing, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Development should be done against our `dev` branch.
- The project's source code is in UTF-8 character encoding.
- Ensure that all unit tests pass.
- Integration tests may not be runnable as they rely on resources in our filesystem.

For further questions or clarifications, feel free to contact us.
